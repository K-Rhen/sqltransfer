<h1>SQLtransfer</h1>
<p>
SQLtransfer is a small program written in Java, which can be used to transfer
data from one database or directory-service to another database. Any database with an 
JDBC or ODBC driver can be used to retrieve or write data. Furthermore you can retrieve 
information from directory-services via LDAP. After the transfer it is
possible to alter the information in the target database with the help
of SQL-statements. 
</p>
<p>
SQLtransfer can also be used for databases or drivers, which 
don't have an extended query-language or options. After transferring 
the data to a capable database, all wanted actions can easily be done 
in this database.
</p>
<p>
The program uses a SELECT-statement entered by the user to retrieve
information from the source database. With the metadata of the
resultset a table can be created in the target database and filled with
the records form the source. All that is needed is a SELECT-statement
and the name of the table in the target-database.
</p>
<p>
For the use of the program knowledge is required about making
JDBC-connections to databases and knowledge about the SQL languages of
the source and target database. If you are going to retrieve information 
from a directory-service, you also need to know about LDAP.
</p>
<p>
The program is configured with an 
<a href="../etc/sqltransfer_default.xml">XML-file</a>. An explanation of the
options can be found in the file sqltransfer_default.xml.

<h2>Working with SQLtransfer</h2>

<h3>What does SQLtransfer do</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>executes a given query in the source database</li>
	<li>determines metadata of result</li>
	<li>create a table with the columns and types in the metadata and with the given tablename in the target database</li>
	<li>inserts all the records of the source result in the target table</li>
	<li>executes the postqueries to alter the information in the target database</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Logging of SQLtransfer</h3>
<p>
All actions of PrepareImportTables are logged in the log-file of the WHERE?.
The queries executed and generated are also logged, so in case of problems one is able to determine the cause.
Exceptions of the used databases are also shown here. 
Sometimes the exceptions can be unclear, because the used databases give us no clear information, which makes resolving problems not easy. 
</p>

<h2>Installing a new JDBC-driver</h2>
<p>
New drivers for JDBC-connections can easily be added, so that support for new databases is possible. 
You must obtain the driver of the manufacturer. 
This driver (usually a jar-file) must be placed in the directory /lib of SQLtransfer.
Edit BATCH
</p>
<h3>Edit shell-script</h3>
<h3>Edit batch-file</h3>
<p>
Find in wrapper.conf the lines starting with:
<pre>
wrapper.java.classpath
</pre>
Add a new line here and increase the number of the last line with 1. 
Further add the filename and the directory at the end. For example the driver for PostGreSQL postgresql-8.0-311.jdbc3.jar in the directory lib:
<pre>
wrapper.java.classpath.4=lib/postgresql-8.0-311.jdbc3.jar
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Edit batch-file</h3>
<p>
In the file settings.xml you can enter the new properties for the driver (driver-class, url, username, password).
<pre>
		&lt;database&gt;PostGreSQL&lt;/database&gt;
		&lt;jdbc&gt;
			&lt;driver&gt;org.postgresql.Driver&lt;/driver&gt;
			&lt;url&gt;jdbc:postgresql://HOSTNAME/DATABASENAME&lt;/url&gt;
			&lt;user&gt;USERNAME&lt;/user&gt;
			&lt;password&gt;PASSWORD&lt;/password&gt;
		&lt;/jdbc&gt;
</pre>

- now a xsd instead of a dtd for validating the xml
- completed the rewrite from PrepareImportTables to SQLtransfer
- added the prepare target database option 

Version 0.9:
- Support for getting information with LDAP added
- now possible to define syntax for drop table statement

Version 0.7
- made multiple drop-table errors possible
- added new element drop-table-message
- made multiple pre- or postqueries errors possible
- now uses length information in translationtypes
- for users with less Java-knowledge just the error is printed and no stacktrace

Version 0.6
- created dtd for settings.xml

Version 0.5
- possibility of suppressing error for postquery
- possibility of executing queries before the transfer

Version 0.4
- code review and better internal structure

Version 0.3
- information of the record to be inserted is printed in the log
- during the transfer a count of records is shown each 1000 records
- with an error the information is repeated with a extra message

Version 0.2
